1) open Anaconda Navigator (type it into search field)
2) Launch cmd.exe Prompt

#type into cmd:
activate py2

#move to directory containing GoldExt by typing
cd C:\Users\q183cs\Documents\GitHub\GoldExt

#start GUI by typing
Python Main.py

#load image (tried .tif, .jpg and .png only .png works)
#if image is in another format than .png open it in imageJ and use Save As... to convert the images to .png
(Fiji is here: C:\Users\q183cs\Documents\GitHub\calciumImagingAnalysis\_external_programs\fiji-win64-20151222\Fiji.app\ImageJ-win64.exe)

1) load image (Open Image File)
2) click "Set Scale Bar" and draw the scale bar (2 seperate mouse clicks)
3) click "Draw Synaptic Area Ouline" and draw it (seperate mouse clicks)
4) click "Connect Synaptic Area Endings" to close the Synaptic Area = SDP
5) click "Mark Small Gold Particles"  and click on all of them, you can Zoom in and out with the mouse wheel and delete a wrong click with "Delete Small"
6) Save State and Image whenenver you stop

If you have higher localization point densities (300-400 µm-2) use 2D ACF g(r) and/or NND analysis of single SDPs
If you have low localization point densities (100 µm-2) use 2D ACF population-wise comparison g(r) values against corresponding randomization data


INTERPRETATION:

NND
- mean NND larger than random distribution = uniform pattern
- mean NND smaller than random distribution = clustered pattern

2D ACF
- mean g(r) of ACF smaller than random distribution = uniform pattern
- mean g(r) of ACF larger than random distribution = clustered pattern 

CLUSTER ANALYSIS

DBSCAN(DB) performs best for 30 and 60 µm-2 cluster densities!

/ minimum number of points per cluster = 3
/ maximal distance between two localization points (to be considered in the same cluster) e = 50?nm
/ for BC:  ‘extra space’ = 200?nm (adds 200nm to SDP, thereby increasing performance)

Data Analysis BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE: 

A) WHICH ANALYSIS IS BEST TO DISTINGUISH CLUSTERS FROM RANDOM PATTERNS

- ACF and NND outperformed the others, resulting in an error rate of 0% at all localization point densities above 300 µm-2 in case of the multiple-cluster models.
  Their performance was also remarkably good for the T- and ring-shaped patterns above the localization point density of 400 µm-2.

- ACF 2D Population-wise comparisons are more powerful in detecting differences at low localization point densities (100 µm-2)

Details (skip if not interested):

Error rates calculated from 20 models, which are individually compared to 200 random distributions.
Models with their computed parameter falling <2.5% and >97.5% of that of the random distributions were considered ‘significantly’ different from random.
The error rates are plotted as a function of localization densities and are shown for the 5 different measures on the 4 different clustered patterns 
(Figure 1e-i, Miklos Szoboszlay, Tekla Kirizs & Zoltan Nusser et al., Sci Reports 2017): 

1)' 2D ACF': 2D autocorrelation function g(r)
2) 'NND': nearest neighbor distances
3) 'all to all': distances between all gold particels
4) 'centroid': distance of each point from the center of mass of the localization points
5) 'closest edge': distance of each point from the closest edge of the structure delineating polygon (SDP)

From these five measures, ACF and NND outperformed the others, resulting in an error rate of 0% at all localization point densities above 300 µm-2 in case of the multiple-cluster models.
Their performance was also remarkably good for the T- and ring-shaped patterns above the localization point density of 400 µm-2.
These data, taken together, demonstrate that both ACF and NND measures are ideal for distinguishing between random and clustered patterns at the level of individual SDP.

BUT:

# in large rectangular areas: 
/ g(r) value of 1 indicates randomly distributed points --> only true for large rectangular! (Miklos Szoboszlay, Tekla Kirizs & Zoltan Nusser et al., Sci Reports 2017)
/ g(r) values smaller than 1 correspond to uniform patterns
/ g(r) values?larger than?1 indicate clustered patterns
# as we dont have rectangular synapses --> compare the mean g(r) value of the simulated or experimental data to that of their corresponding randomizations
# to assess statistical significance!

# ACF 2D Population-wise comparisons are more powerful in detecting differences at low localization point densities (100 µm-2) 
# Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U post hoc test with Bonferroni adjustment


B) WHICH ANALYSIS IS BEST TO DISTINGUISH UNIFORM FROM RANDOM PATTERNS

- both NND and ACF perform well for densities from 100-800 µm-2 
(see Figure 2: Miklos Szoboszlay, Tekla Kirizs & Zoltan Nusser et al., Sci Reports 2017)

C) After analyzing the localization point distribution patterns based on the methods above, INVESTIGATE IF CLUSTERS COULD BE IDENTIFIED OR NOT
4 methods tested:

1) DBSCAN (DB)
2) affinity propagation (AP)
3) mean shift (MS)
4) Bayesian clustering (BC)

user-defined parameters derived from localization point distribution patterns!

For comparison of multiple-cluster models, we calculated the adjusted Rand score (ARS)
ARS computes similarity measures between two clusterings element-wise. 
ARS values close to 0 indicate random cluster assignments, whereas an ARS value 1.0 indicates identical cluster assignments.

DBSCAN(DB) performs best for 30 and 60 µm-2 cluster densities at localization point density of 200-650 µm-2 (200 µm-2 worked best)
