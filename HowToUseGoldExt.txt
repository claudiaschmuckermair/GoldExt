Under 'Measure Selection'
- Distance measurements: Click Generate (with 2D ACF) --> generates random data + experimental data --> distance_measurmetns.xslx file holds NND, all-to-all,centroid and closest edge of experimental data + all random data
  pdf holds plots of all randomly generated datasets (plotting the localization of random gold particles + NND cumulative probability distribution + All distances
  2D_ACF.xlsx holds radius (nm) experimental data and 2D_ACF values for the randomly generated datasets

e.g. 84453_H3_x53
15nm goldparticles (pan-AMPA): 57
active zone (AZ) area: 0.022 um2
Total area: 0.285 um2 (whole pic)
--> localization point densitiy approx 200 / um2 

If you have higher localization point densities (300-400 µm-2) use 2D ACF g(r) and/or NND analysis of single SDPs
If you have low localization point densities (100 µm-2) use 2D ACF population-wise comparison g(r) values against corresponding randomization data

--> NND analysis should be fine: mean NND (experimental data)  = 0.011486102
                                 mean NND (50 random datasets) = 0.014202022

INTERPRETATION:

NND
- mean NND larger than random distribution = uniform pattern
- mean NND smaller than random distribution = clustered pattern

--> AMPAR distribution in AZ of 84453_H3_x53 is clustered

Check 2D ACF to verify:
mean g(r) (experimental data)  = 0.893524515
mean g(r) (50 random datasets) = 0.951204728

2D ACF
- mean g(r) of ACF smaller than random distribution = uniform pattern
- mean g(r) of ACF larger than random distribution = clustered pattern 

--> AMPAR distribution in AZ of 84453_H3_x53 is uniform 

--> thats why one synapse is not enough!


CLUSTER ANALYSIS

DBSCAN(DB) performs best for 30 and 60 µm-2 cluster densities!

/ minimum number of points per cluster = 3
/ maximal distance between two localization points (to be considered in the same cluster) e = 50?nm
/ for BC:  ‘extra space’ = 200?nm (adds 200nm to SDP, thereby increasing performance)

Data Analysis BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE: 

A) WHICH ANALYSIS IS BEST TO DISTINGUISH CLUSTERS FROM RANDOM PATTERNS

- ACF and NND outperformed the others, resulting in an error rate of 0% at all localization point densities above 300 µm-2 in case of the multiple-cluster models.
  Their performance was also remarkably good for the T- and ring-shaped patterns above the localization point density of 400 µm-2.

- ACF 2D Population-wise comparisons are more powerful in detecting differences at low localization point densities (100 µm-2)

Details (skip if not interested):

Error rates calculated from 20 models, which are individually compared to 200 random distributions.
Models with their computed parameter falling <2.5% and >97.5% of that of the random distributions were considered ‘significantly’ different from random.
The error rates are plotted as a function of localization densities and are shown for the 5 different measures on the 4 different clustered patterns 
(Figure 1e-i, Miklos Szoboszlay, Tekla Kirizs & Zoltan Nusser et al., Sci Reports 2017): 

1)' 2D ACF': 2D autocorrelation function g(r)
2) 'NND': nearest neighbor distances
3) 'all to all': distances between all gold particels
4) 'centroid': distance of each point from the center of mass of the localization points
5) 'closest edge': distance of each point from the closest edge of the structure delineating polygon (SDP)

From these five measures, ACF and NND outperformed the others, resulting in an error rate of 0% at all localization point densities above 300 µm-2 in case of the multiple-cluster models.
Their performance was also remarkably good for the T- and ring-shaped patterns above the localization point density of 400 µm-2.
These data, taken together, demonstrate that both ACF and NND measures are ideal for distinguishing between random and clustered patterns at the level of individual SDP.

BUT:

# in large rectangular areas: 
/ g(r) value of 1 indicates randomly distributed points --> only true for large rectangular! (Miklos Szoboszlay, Tekla Kirizs & Zoltan Nusser et al., Sci Reports 2017)
/ g(r) values smaller than 1 correspond to uniform patterns
/ g(r) values?larger than?1 indicate clustered patterns
# as we dont have rectangular synapses --> compare the mean g(r) value of the simulated or experimental data to that of their corresponding randomizations
# to assess statistical significance!

# ACF 2D Population-wise comparisons are more powerful in detecting differences at low localization point densities (100 µm-2) 
# Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U post hoc test with Bonferroni adjustment


B) WHICH ANALYSIS IS BEST TO DISTINGUISH UNIFORM FROM RANDOM PATTERNS

- both NND and ACF perform well for densities from 100-800 µm-2 
(see Figure 2: Miklos Szoboszlay, Tekla Kirizs & Zoltan Nusser et al., Sci Reports 2017)

C) After analyzing the localization point distribution patterns based on the methods above, INVESTIGATE IF CLUSTERS COULD BE IDENTIFIED OR NOT
4 methods tested:

1) DBSCAN (DB)
2) affinity propagation (AP)
3) mean shift (MS)
4) Bayesian clustering (BC)

user-defined parameters derived from localization point distribution patterns!

For comparison of multiple-cluster models, we calculated the adjusted Rand score (ARS)
ARS computes similarity measures between two clusterings element-wise. 
ARS values close to 0 indicate random cluster assignments, whereas an ARS value 1.0 indicates identical cluster assignments.

DBSCAN(DB) performs best for 30 and 60 µm-2 cluster densities at localization point density of 200-650 µm-2 (200 µm-2 worked best)
